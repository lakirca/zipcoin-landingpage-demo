                    this stage or later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    17. Legal Risk concerning Security Regulation. There is a risk that in some jurisdictions
                    ZIPCOIN Utility Tokens might be considered to be a security, now or in the future.
                    Company does not give warranties or guarantees that ZIPCOIN Utility Token are not a
                    security in all jurisdictions. Each user of ZIPCOIN shall bear its own legal or financial
                    consequences of ZIPCOIN Utility Token being considered a security in their respective
                    jurisdiction​. The legal ability of Company to provide ZIPCOIN Utility Tokens in some
                    jurisdictions may be eliminated by future regulation or legal actions. In the event, it turns
                    out with a high degree of certainty that ZIPCOIN Utility Tokens are not legal in certain
                    jurisdiction, Company will base on its sole discretion either (a) cease operations in that
                    jurisdiction, or (b) adjust ZIPCOIN Utility Tokens in a way to comply with the regulation
                    should that be possible and viable. It is your obligation to check if acquisition and
                    disposal of ZIPCOIN Utility Tokens is legal in your jurisdiction​, and by accepting
                    these Terms you expressly agree​ and warrant that you will not use ZIPCOIN should
                    their use not be legal in the relevant jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    18. Risk of malfunction of blockchain. Nobody can guarantee the EOS source code used by
                    Company will be flaw-free. It may contain certain flaws, errors, defects and bugs, which
                    may disable some functionality for users, expose users’ information or otherwise. Such
                flaw would compromise the usability and/or security of Company and consequently bring
                adverse impact on the value of Company open source codes rely on transparency to
                promote community-sourced identification and solution of problems within the code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    19. Update of the Source Code. The EOS source code could be updated, amended, altered or
                    modified from time to time by the developers and/or the community of EOS. Nobody is
                    able to foresee or guarantee the precise result of such update, amendment, alteration or
                    modification. As a result, any update, amendment, alteration or modification could lead
                    to an unexpected or unintended outcome that adversely affects ZIPCOIN Utility Tokens
                    and/or Company operation or market value.
                </p>            
                <p>
                    20. Internet transmission risks. You acknowledge that there are risks associated with utilizing
                    an Internet-based digital assets, products and website including, but not limited to, the
                    failure of hardware, software, and Internet connections. You acknowledge that the
                    Company shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors,
                    distortions or delays you may experience when using our services, website, platform,
                    ZIPCOIN Utility Tokens howsoever caused.
                </p>
                <p>
                    21. Cryptography risks. You acknowledge that there are risks associated with cryptography,
                    such as code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum
                    computers, could present risks to all crypto-currencies including ZIPCOIN Utility
                    Tokens. This could result in the theft, loss, disappearance, destruction or devaluation of
                    ZIPCOIN. To a reasonable extent, Company will be prepared to take proactive or
                    remedial steps to update the protocol underlying Company in response to any advances in
                    cryptography and to incorporate additional reasonable security measures where
                    appropriate. It is impossible to predict the future of cryptography or the future of security
                    innovations to an extent that would permit the Company accurately guide the
                    development of Company to take into account such unforeseeable changes in the domains
                    of cryptography or security.
                </p>                    
                <p>
                    22. Forking. EOS is an open source project and supported by the community. The developers
                    of the Company do not lead the development, marketing, operation or otherwise of EOS.
                    Anybody may develop a patch or upgrade of the source code of EOS’s source
                    without prior authorization of anyone else. ​The acceptance of EOS patches or
                    upgrades by a significant, but not overwhelming, percentage of the users could result in a
                    “fork” in the blockchain of EOS, and consequently the operation of two separate
                    networks and will remain separate until the forked blockchains are merged. The
                    temporary or permanent existence of forked blockchains could adversely impact the
                    operation and the market value of ZIPCOIN and in the worst case scenario, could ruin the
                    sustainability of the Company. While such a fork in the blockchain of EOS would
                    possibly be resolved by community-led efforts to merge the forked blockchains, the
                    success is not guaranteed and could take long period of time to achieve.
                </p>                    
                <p>
                    23. Risk of unfavorable regulatory action in one or more jurisdictions. Blockchain
                    technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the
                    world. ZIPCOIN could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions,
                    including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of ZIPCOIN, which
                    could impede or limit their existence, permissibility of their use and possession, and their
                    value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    24. Risk of theft and hacking. Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to
                    interfere with your third-party wallet, the Website or the availability of ZIPCOIN Utility
                    Tokens in any number of ways, including without limitation denial of service attacks,
                    Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    25. Risk of mining attacks. EOS blockchain, which is used for the ZIPCOIN Utility Tokens,
                    is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks,
                    majority mining power attacks,“selfish-mining”attacks, and race condition attacks.
                    Mining Attacks, as described above, may also target other blockchain networks, with

                    and governance to the users. These tokens will be issued by a technical process referred
                    to as a «blockchain». This is an open source IT protocol over which the Company has no
                    rights or liability in terms of its development and operation. The token distribution
                    mechanism will be controlled by EOS​; this involves a computer program that can be
                    executed on the EOS network or on another «blockchain» network that is compatible
                    with the EOS programming language. User acknowledge and understand therefore that
                    ZIPCOIN (incl. its bodies and employees) assumes no liability or responsibility for any
                    loss or damage that would result from or relate to the incapacity to use the ZIPCOIN
                    Utility Token excepted in case of intentional misconduct or gross negligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    36. ZIPCOIN is based on the EOS protocol. EOS.IO software utilizes the only known
                    decentralized consensus algorithm proven capable of meeting the performance
                    requirements of applications on the blockchain, Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS). Under
                    this algorithm, those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO software may
                    select block producers through a continuous approval voting system. Anyone may choose
                    to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks,
                    provided they can persuade token holders to vote for them.
                    37. The EOS.IO software enables blocks to be produced exactly every 0.5 second and exactly
                    one producer is authorized to produce a block at any given point in time. If the block is
                    not produced at the scheduled time, then the block for that time slot is skipped. When one
                    or more blocks are skipped, there is a 0.5 or more second gap in the blockchain.
                    36. Therefore, any malfunction, unplanned function or unexpected operation of the EOS
                    protocol may cause the ZIPCOIN Utility Token network to malfunction or operate in a
                    way that is not expected.
